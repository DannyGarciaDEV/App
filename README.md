- **CSS**: Styles the webpage with a focus on layout, typography, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the logic for currency conversion and hamburger menu functionality.

## How It Works

1. **USDC to USD/BTC Calculation**:
    - The user enters an amount in USDC.
    - Clicking the "Calculate" button triggers a function that computes the equivalent amounts in USD (1 USDC = 1 USD) and BTC (1 BTC = 35,000 USD).
    - The result is displayed below the input.

2. **Responsive Navigation**:
    - On smaller screens (mobile), the navigation collapses into a hamburger menu.
    - Clicking the hamburger icon toggles the visibility of the menu.
